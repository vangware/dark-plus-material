**v1.0.12**

The default Dark+ Theme, with material palette.

## Reason

I really love the default Dark+ Theme that comes with Visual Studio Code, but also love the Material Design Palette. The thing is I didn't found a good material theme (the coloring is always ugly for my taste). So I made this theme that implements the Material Design Palette in the Dark+ theme that comes with Visual Studio Code.

More than 50k downloads! Thanks a lot for the love!
