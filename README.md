# Dark+ Material

## Version 2: More Dark, More Material

This is the default Dark+ Theme that comes with Visual Studio Code, but with the Material palette.

## Reason behind this

I really love the default Dark+ Theme that comes with Visual Studio Code, but also love the Material Design Palette. The thing is I didn't found a good material theme (the coloring is always ugly for my taste). So I made this theme that implements the Material Design Palette in the Dark+ theme that comes with Visual Studio Code.

**Almost 600k downloads! Almost 90k installs! In the top 10 of most downloaded themes!**

Thanks a lot for the love â™¥

## The update process

```
VSCode update -> mapping (1 VSCode color => 1 Material color) -> Dark+ Material update.
```
