# Dark+ Material
The default Dark+ Theme, with material palette.

## Reason

I really love the default Dark+ Theme that comes with Visual Studio Code, but
also love the Material Design Palette. The thing is I didn't found a good
material theme (the coloring is always ugly for my taste). So I made this theme
that implements the Material Design Palette in the Dark+ theme that comes with
Visual Studio Code.
