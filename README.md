# Dark+ Material

![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/vangware/dark-plus-material/master/assets/logo.png)

The default Dark+ Theme, with material palette and always up to date.

**Almost than 400k downloads! In the top 10 of most downloaded themes!** Thanks a lot for the love â™¥

## Reason

I really love the default Dark+ Theme that comes with Visual Studio Code, but also love the Material Design Palette. The thing is I didn't found a good material theme (the coloring is always ugly for my taste). So I made this theme that implements the Material Design Palette in the Dark+ theme that comes with Visual Studio Code.
